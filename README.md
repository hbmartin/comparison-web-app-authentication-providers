Its React and Next.js integration make it ideal for React/Vue/Next projects. | Excellent developer experience. Clerk provides SDKs with pre-built React components and support for Next.js, Remix, React Native, etc. Documentation and support are strong. |
| Firebase Authentication                                      | Spark plan ~3k daily users; Blaze pay-as-you-go includes ~50k MAUs free | BaaS auth service (part of Google Firebase)        | Google-backed, email/password, phone OTP, and popular social logins out-of-the-box, anonymous guest auth and custom token authentication.

Good for building a custom identity service or integrating deeply into microservices. | Developer-centric solution: no ready-made hosted UI (though a reference UI is available). You interact via REST APIs/SDKs, so expect to write glue code. |
