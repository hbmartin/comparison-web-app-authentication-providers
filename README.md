| [AuthKit](https://www.authkit.com/)<br />-<br />SaaS identity platform (OAuth, SSO) | Free under 1M MAU, $2,500 / mo. for each add'l 1M MAU        | Supports OAuth, SSO, and advanced features like SAML, SCIM, and RBAC. | Suitable for applications requiring enterprise-level authentication features with a generous free tier. | Highly friendly with comprehensive documentation and support for various integration scenarios. |

Suitable for large user bases but be prepared for AWS-centric configuration. | Requires effort: AWS’s docs are extensive but  confusing, and user management tasks can be clunky. Learning curve esp. when not familiar with AWS services. |
| Azure App Service Auth<br />-<br />Cloud CIAM by Microsoft (Azure AD B2C) | Part of Azure subscription                                   | Microsoft-backed, Built-in auth middleware                   | Enterprise apps, corporate systems                           |                                                              |
| [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)<br />-<br />User management platform (SaaS, developer-first) | $0.02  / MAU, free under 10k MAU                             | Complete and easy-to-integrate solution, Polished UI, advanced capabilities like orgs/teams support (for B2B SaaS), ability for users to maintain multiple sessions, built-in password breach checks | Modern web applications (e.g. SPA's) that want to offload the entire user management UI and logic to a service.

Clerk provides SDKs with pre-built React components and support for Next.js, Remix, React Native, etc. Documentation and support are strong. |
| [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)<br />-<br />BaaS auth service (part of Google Firebase) | Spark plan ~3k daily users; Blaze pay-as-you-go includes ~50k MAUs free | Google-backed, email/password, phone OTP, and popular social logins out-of-the-box, anonymous guest auth and custom token authentication. Tight integration with other Firebase services | Rapid development of mobile and web apps, especially those already in the Firebase/Google ecosystem. Apps with moderate user bases that want hassle-free backend management. | Client SDKs handle most auth flows with just a few lines of code. Setup is simple via the Firebase console, and docs are comprehensive. Little backend work needed |
| [Hank.io](https://www.hanko.io/)<br />[GitHub](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko)<br />-<br />Open-source authentication (passwordless) | Cloud: $0.01 / MAU, free under 10k MAU                       | Focus on passkey authentication, providing backend services for OAuth SSO, user mgmt, and JWT issuance.

Setup and integration can be involvede.g. realms, clients, etc., then use OIDC/SAML libraries in your app. Steep learning curve. |
| [Nhost Auth](https://nhost.io/product/auth)<br />[GitHub](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth)<br />-<br />BaaS with integrated auth (GraphQL) | No MAU limit, 1GB storage free                               | Provides a full backend service with GraphQL API, authentication, storage, and serverless functions.

Good for building a custom identity service or integrating deeply into microservices. | Developer-centric solution: no ready-made hosted UI (though a reference UI is available). You interact via REST APIs/SDKs, so expect to write glue code. |
